% Intro
My name is Razvan Valentin Marinescu and I am a first-year PhD student in the Medical Imaging CDT at UCL. I would be interested to take part in the mini-MD course this October because it is a fantastic opportunity that would allow me to observe how medical imaging works in clinical practice and get hands-on experience from clinicians involved in patient care. My supervisor Prof. Daniel Alexander has informed me about this course and would be more than happy for me to take part in it.

% my project
My PhD project is on \emph{Data-driven disease progression modelling of Alzheimer's subtypes}. We hope to use disease progression models to help us understand how different types of dementias work, what causes them and perform patient staging in drug trials. Therefore, I believe this miniMD course would be very useful for me because it would help me understand more about how clinicians work with patients suffering from dementia and what their true needs are. It would also be very useful to spend one week observing cardiovascular imaging and clinical practice at the Royal Free Hospital, where I can find out how to translate the technologies I develop in my PhD project to the clinic.

% more about he course
Furthermore, this opportunity would also provide me access to unique clinical facilities and I can make important contacts with leading researchers and clinicians in their field. I would also take part in multidisciplinary team meetings, clinical diagnostics, operating theatre sessions, ward rounds and state-of-the-art clinical research facilities. 

At the end of the course, we will also write a small report and give a presentation to the other CDT students describing our experience. In my opinion, this would also be a fine opportunity for us to practice our presentation skills, which will be very important in our future research careers, where we always need to communicate our research ideas to fellow scientists and to the general public. 

Given the multidisciplinary nature of my project, I believe that taking part in this course would be very beneficial, allowing me to get further insights into clinical practice. If I am offered the place, I will endeavour to make the most out of it. I look forward to hearing from you.\\\\

Yours sincerely,\\

Razvan Valentin Marinescu
